		<br><p>The object of the game is to form rows of five poker chips, known as sequences, on the board by playing cards from your hand and placing chips on the corresponding board spaces.</p><br>
	</div>
	<div class="tab-pane fade in" id="directions">
		<br><p>Sequence can be played individually with two players or team-based with two teams of two players.</p>
		<p>To decide who goes first, roll a six-sided die.  Each player will then be dealt six cards.</p>
		<p>Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board.</p>
		<p>Choose a card from your hand, and place a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: you choose Ace of Diamonds from your hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks are wild. Red Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a counter on any space on the board. Black Jacks can remove an opponent’s token from a space. Players may use the red Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and black Jacks can remove an opponent’s advantage. However, black Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence. Once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands.</p>
		<p>The played card then goes face-up into a “Discard” pile, and the turn is completed.</p>
		<p>A player may place chips on either or both of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent’s marker chip.</p><br>

		<br><p>The game ends when a player or team completes two sequences.</p><br>

		<br><p><em>What do I do after I have played my turn?</em><br>The game will notify your opponent it is their turn. Feel free to do something else or play other games of Sequence!</p>
		<p><em>How can I get a High Score?</em><br>You will earn one point towards your high score for every game of Sequence you finish.  Additionally, winning games in tournament mode will earn you bonus high score points.</p><br>
