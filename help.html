						<li><strong>Game Objective:</strong><p>The object of the game is to form rows of five poker chips on the board by placing the chips on the board spaces corresponding to cards played from your hand.</p></li>
						<li><strong>Directions:</strong><p>Sequence can be played with two to 12 players, so long as the number of players is divisible by two or three. If there are more than three individual players, they should divide evenly into two or three teams (up to three teams of four players). With two teams, players alternate their physical positions with opponents around the playing surface. With three teams, players of a team must be positioned at every third player around the playing surface.</p>
							<p>Place the game board on a flat surface (such as the floor or a table) with enough room to allow for the draw deck, a discard pile and marker chips. Remove the jokers, if any, from the deck as they are not used in the game.</p>
							<p>To decide who goes first, one player then shuffles the card decks into one stack. Each player takes a card from the deck. The player with the lowest card deals. Shuffle once more. Each player or team then chooses a set of poker chips, and all members of each team must use the same color chips (red is only used if there are three teams).</p>
							<p>The number of cards dealt to each player varies by the number of people playing: Two Players: Seven cards each Three Players: Six cards each Four Players: Six cards each Six Players: Five cards each Eight Players: Four cards each Nine Players: Four cards each Ten Players: Three cards each Twelve Players: Three cards each.</p>
							<p>Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board.</p>
							<p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first.</p>
							<p>Choose a card from your hand, and place a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: you choose Ace of Diamonds from your hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks are wild. Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a counter on any space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent’s token from a space. Players may use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent’s advantage. However, One-Eyed Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence. Once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands. Once a Jack is played, it ends the turn.</p>
							<p>The played card then goes face-up into a “Discard” pile, and play passes to the left.</p>
							<p>A player may place chips on either or both of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent’s marker chip.</p>
							<p>If a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game board, the card is considered, “dead,” and may be exchanged for a new card. When it is your turn, place the dead on card on the discard pile, announce you are turning in a dead card, and take a replacement (one card per turn). Then proceed to play your normal turn.</p>
						</li>
						<li><strong>How to Win:</strong><p>The game ends when a player completes the winning amount of sequences: two sequences for two players or teams; one sequence for three players or teams.</p></li>
